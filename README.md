# Basic Redis Examples for .NET using StackExchange.Redis

The code in these example makes a few assumptions:

- You have a local Redis server running on port 6379.
- You have the StackExchange.Redis (SE.R) package installed locally.

You can download Redis from [redis.io](https://redis.io/download) or you can run the [Redis Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis).

StackExchange.Redis can be installed using NuGet. Use the package name `StackExchange.Redis`.

To run the code, run:

`dotnet run`

from the terminal or through an IDE VS Code, JetBrains Rider, or Visual Studio.
