# dot-net-redis-intro

The code in this illustrations in this repo make a few assumptions.

- You have a local installation of redis running
- You have the StackExchange.Redis (SE.R) package installed locally

Redis can be downloaded from redis.io or you can use a docker image.
SE.R can be installed using nuget using the package name `StackExchange.Redis`

The code can be exercised with `dotnet run` from the terminal or through an IDE that understands solution files like VS Code, JetBrains Rider, or Visual Studio.
